# Nebula Workbook

## Project Description

**Nebula Workbook** is a web application designed to help computer science students master the concepts of Data Structures and Algorithms. This often challenging course serves as a roadblock for many students, and **Nebula Workbook** aims to provide an accessible, simple resource that effectively teaches the material without the need for expensive digital textbook licenses.

Developed by Weber State University students as part of a capstone project, **Nebula Workbook** provides interactive learning experiences, including quizzes, coding exercises, and tutorials, designed to support students throughout their journey in the course.

## Features

- **Interactive Quizzes**: Students can test their knowledge with dynamic quizzes on data structures and algorithms.
- **IDE for Practice**: Integrated coding environment for practicing and executing algorithms.
- **Video Tutorials**: Embedded educational videos to reinforce learning.
- **Chapter Mastery Tracking**: Tracks student progress through chapters and exercises, ensuring comprehensive learning.
- **Admin and Teacher Roles**: For course management and monitoring student progress.
- **Responsive Design**: Fully responsive layout for accessibility across devices.
- **Light/Dark Theme**: Customizable theme for optimal user experience.
